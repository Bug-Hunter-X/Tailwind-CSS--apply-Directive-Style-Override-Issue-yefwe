This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive within a class that's also using other Tailwind CSS directives or custom CSS styles.  The `@apply` directive attempts to apply the styles from a utility class, but if those styles clash with or are overridden by other styles within the same class, it can lead to unexpected visual results, not errors as such, but incorrect rendering.
